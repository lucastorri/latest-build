Entry name:
twetalk


Description:
We allow attendees and presenters of a talk to interact with each other through tweets.

Accessing our App, one is able to add conferences and their respective talks and once that is done...

 => presenters can:
   * have feedback on their presentations
   * notify public about related new (share slides, etc)

  => attendees can:
    * provide feedback
    * discuss talk contents and subject
    * know other attendees
    * look for presentation news

Tweets sent to a talk are always accessible, so you are to able to check what is going on whenever you want.


Instructions:
It wasn't tested against Internet Explorer, so it probably doesn't work on it. Should work fine in webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) as well as Firefox..

First of all, go to http://latest-build.nko2.nodeknockout.com/ :)

Once you are there, you'll be able to check for the upcoming conferences, but we believe you might haven an awesome conference to add. For that, click on 'Add your conference'.

Fill the forms with the conference info and add as many talks as it have. This part is kind of painful, but think how cool it's going to be when all the attendees and presenters are interacting with each others thanks to you :P

Save it and your conference is now listed on the home screen \o/. When clicking on it, everybody will be able to see a schedule with the available talks and that's where the fun starts. Check out the 'Login with Twitter' button on the upper left corner. You guessed right: time to login :D

Now, click on a talk, that one you are willing to see. You'll see that a new widget will open. Drag and resize it at your will. Nothing on there? Time to start tweeting about it. What about "That talk looks great. I'm looking forward to see it!"?

Congratulations! You are the first one to twetalk on this talk and soon others will join you as well.
